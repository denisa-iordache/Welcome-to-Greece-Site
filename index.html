        <h4>About Us</h4>
        <p>
          Located right above Toroneos Bay these luxury villas and suites in
          Halkidiki combine elegance and minimalist design with the typically
          Greek blue-green background. The amphitheatrical position, the modern
          amenities and the gourmet restaurant make Kappa Resort an ideal choice
          for both family and romantic getaways.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our resort comprises luxurious villas of four different types (1, 2, 3
          or 4 bedrooms), all with private pools. Furthermore, it has standard
          suites (1, 2 or 3 bedrooms) with private pool, as well as apartments
          (junior suites, 1 or 2 bedrooms) with shared pool.
        </p>

        <p>All accommodation come with a magnificent sea view.</p>

        <p>
          At the southern end of Kassandra peninsula, only 120 km from
          Thessaloniki Aiport (SKG), lies Paliouri, a quiet and traditional
          village. It is built on a hill, amphitheatrically towards Toroneos bay
          and it is surrounded by pine forest. Paliouri is know for its deep
          blue sandy beaches. It remains a stable attraction for tourists,
          especially during summer season.
        </p>
        <h4>History</h4>
        <p>
          An old legend claims that today Paliouri was an ancient city named
          Theramvos, which is confirmed by archaeological finds from the area,
          while the city is also mentioned by Herodotus. According to Herodotus,
          the city recruited forcibly by Xerxes and speculated that this is why
          there are no reports of later writers. During the period of Turkish
          rule, Paliouri was one of the 12 villages that formed the foundation
          of Gkazanfer Aga and villagers participated in the Revolution of 1821.
          The name of the village is due to “paliouria”, thorny shrubs used
          previously for fencing houses. It belongs to the Municipality of
          Kassandra and obtains all modern hospitality facilities and services.
          There are a lot of foreign visitors, mainly during summer months. The
          village still retains its traditional character consisting of narrow
          streets and many houses with 19th-century architecture. Finally, if
          you get there, do not forget to buy honey and olive oil, products for
          which Paliouri is famous for.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, apart from Paliouri, we would suggest you to visit the other
          picturesque and traditional villages of Kassandra and the enchanting
          beaches.
